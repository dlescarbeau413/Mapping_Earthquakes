# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this module, we created data visualizations to look at earthquakes that happened around the world. To do this, we used GeoJSON data from the USGS and leaflet to plot the data on a mapbox map. The locations where these earthquakes happened were plotted in different colors and sizes to show the severity of the earthquake. The more sever the earthquake the darker and larger the circle is. The less sever earthquakes are shown with smaller and lighter colored circles. The color scale can be seen at the bottom righthand corner of the map. If you click the location of the earthquake, a popup box appears with the magnitude and the location of the earthquake. Along with the color scale for the locations, we added different maps in which the user can toggle through with three different types of maps. The three different maps the user can toggle through is a street view map, satellite view map and a dark map. The user can also toggle on and off the different data points that they want to see.There are three different datapoints that we plotted on this map. We plotted the techtonic plate locations, earthquakes and even added a layer for the most sever earthquakes. The code for the final chanllenge is located in the challenge_logic2 javascript file.
